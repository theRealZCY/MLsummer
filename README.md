Titanic:
1. SVM and kNN use code svm_titanic.py and knn_titanic.py with file "train.csv” (make   sure the plot_learning_curve.py is in the same directory)
2. DT, Boost, and NN use Weka through "tranweka.csv"

Occupancy:
1. kNN use code svm_titanic.py and knn.py with file "datatraining.txt.csv" and "datatest2copy.csv"(make sure the plot_learning_curve.py is in the same directory)
2. SVM use code svm_titanic.py and svm.py with file "datatraining_copy.csv”(make sure the plot_learning_curve.py is in the same directory)
3. DT, Boost, and NN use Weka through "datatraining_weka.txt.csv"
